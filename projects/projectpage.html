                                <p> Lynks is a Point of Sale (POS) system developed using Flutter, designed to
                                    streamline the order management process for restaurants. This application provides a
                                    unified platform for handling orders from various online sources, eliminating the
                                    need for multiple dashboards and simplifying the overall order management
                                    experience. The source code for this project is available on GitHub, showcasing the
                                    implementation details and the use of Flutter in developing a robust POS system. You
                                    can explore the code and learn more about the project at [Lynks POS

                                <p> I've developed a food ordering website that streamlines the ordering process for
                                    customers. By simply scanning a QR code, customers can access the menu and place
                                    their orders directly through the app. Once the order is placed, the app displays
                                    payment options, allowing for a seamless transaction without the need for manual
                                    order taking. This system not only enhances the customer experience but also
                                    improves the efficiency of the ordering process. The source code for this project is
                                    available on GitHub, and you can explore it at [Food Ordering
                                    Website.

                                <p>I'm thrilled to introduce Lynks, a cutting-edge restaurant order management
                                    solution I developed using Flutter. Lynks, formerly known as Lynks_Order, is
                                    tailored specifically for restaurants, providing a robust and streamlined system for
                                    handling orders across various online platforms. The platform aims to eliminate the
                                    hassle of navigating through multiple dashboards by offering a consolidated and
                                    developer-friendly interface.

                                    As a Flutter project, Lynks sets the stage for a seamless application experience,
                                    efficiently managing online orders and ensuring a smooth process. Key features
                                    include unified order management, real-time updates the oders and it can be
                                    integreated ti any platform like doordash and ubereats ect.

                                    The programming languages used in this project include Dart, C++, CMake, Ruby,
                                    Swift, and HTML. My passion for creating efficient and user-friendly solutions for
                                    the restaurant industry is reflected in Lynks, leveraging the power of Flutter to
                                    deliver a top-notch order management system. This project showcases my expertise in
                                    Flutter and my ability to create innovative solutions that meet the unique needs of
                                    the industry.

                                <p>In my recent project, CWUSA - WordPress Project Development with API Integration, I
                                    undertook the development of a fully functional website using WordPress and
                                    seamlessly integrated it with various APIs. This project allowed me to showcase my
                                    expertise in WordPress development, API integration, and delivering an exceptional
                                    user experience. I developed a dynamic and visually appealing website with a
                                    responsive design, ensuring optimal viewing across different devices. I customized
                                    the WordPress theme and implemented unique features to align with the client's brand
                                    identity. The integration of APIs from third-party platforms enhanced the website's
                                    functionality, enabling features such as payment gateways and social media
                                    integration. I focused on creating a user-friendly interface and intuitive
                                    navigation to improve user engagement. The website was secured with advanced
                                    security measures and optimized for performance, including fast loading times and
                                    efficient caching mechanisms. I also implemented SEO best practices to improve the
                                    website's visibility in search engines. The technologies used in this project
                                    included WordPress CMS, custom theme development, API integration, HTML, CSS,
                                    JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. This project demonstrated my ability to deliver
                                    high-quality WordPress solutions and leverage APIs for seamless integration with
                                    external systems. I am open to new opportunities and excited to contribute to
                                    impactful projects as a skilled WordPress developer who can effectively integrate
                                    APIs and deliver exceptional websites.</p>

                                <p>In my project, HTML To PDF Generator, I developed a web application that converts
                                    HTML content into a PDF document. I utilized HTML and CSS to design the user
                                    interface, where users can input or paste their HTML content. With the integration
                                    of JavaScript functions, the application processes the input and generates a
                                    downloadable PDF file. This feature enhances the usability of the application,
                                    providing a convenient tool for users who need to convert their HTML content into a
                                    portable format. The project is hosted on GitHub, leveraging its free open-source
                                    hosting services to make the tool accessible to a broad audience without any cost.

                                <p>In my Food Delivery site project, I developed a basic web application using HTML and
                                    CSS. The site's home page greets visitors with promotional banners, and there are
                                    sub-pages that provide detailed information about the dishes available and highlight
                                    special offerings. I also included a "Contact Us" page for users to reach out to the
                                    restaurant management. The main feature of this project is that the site is hosted
                                    on GitHub, utilizing its free open-source hosting services, making the website
                                    accessible to a wider audience without any cost.</p>
